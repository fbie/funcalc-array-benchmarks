+#title: Parallel Funcalc Benchmarks

* Intro

We have benchmarked Funcalc on our benchmarking server.  We have benchmarked Funcalc with
[[https://github.com/popular-parallel-programming/funcalc-euses][converted spreadsheets from the EUSES corpus]] using the file ~benchmark.bat~.

The date at which the benchmarks have been run can be found in the file ~build.log~ in each folder.


* Meta-Statistics

How many arrays did the algorithm convert per sheet?

#+begin_src R :session
  errs <- list.files(path="arrays", pattern="err", full.names=TRUE)
  lifts <- sapply(errs, (function (err) {
      for (line in scan(err, what = character(), sep = "\n")) {
          if (grepl("Lifted", line)) {
            return(line)
          }
      }
  }))
  print(cbind(errs, lifts))
